## Our approach
Our principles are at the heart of how we approach product design and development.

--- 

#### Put the user first

Think about the needs of different types of user and be intentional about how to respond to them in a product or feature. Whenever possible, use research to inform your decision-making so you can map your process to how real users think and work.

--- 

#### Empower but don't overwhelm

Even though the systems we design are complicated, they should feel effortless. We accomplish this by removing unnecessary steps and making sure people understand what they need to do throughout the experience.

---

#### Build a cohesive experience

Ipreo should feel like a cohesive experience to users, no matter where they are in the product. Use consistent language, patterns, and components across the interface to make it easier for users to get stuff done.

---

#### Be polished but not ornamental
Ipreo should look good and feel like a world-class experience, but not for the sake of being pretty. Every aesthetic design decision—from how we design components, to illustrations, and choices about color—should be purposeful.
