## Cupcake 1.0 is released

It's been along time coming and thanks to all the teams who have helped along the way. 

And while there is a ton of work left to do, we can comfortably say the public api is stable and the class names you are using will not change. 

**Important Release Note**
 - Name change to the npm package - from ~~@ipreo/cupcake-styles~~ to @ipreo/cupcake

*If you find any bugs please - [File a Issue Here](https://code.ipreo.com/Ipreo/cupcake/issues)*

We are also employing our Visual Regression testing moving forward. This will allow us to screenshot and diff against stable versions - thus any visual changes will not go unseen.

## Up Next

The UX team is working through a number of larger components, layouts, etc. using Cupcake elements. Many of those will be available soon in future releases.

We also have alot more documentation to work through. There are tons of variations and ways to compose a UI with Cupcake, as well as useage rules from UX - we will continue to plow through adding as often as possible.

*If you have any questions please reach out on our slack - [Cupcake Slack](https://ipreo.slack.com/messages/C0T3KNMK7/details/)*
