# 1.1.0 Release Notes

### New Display Properties

+ Support for better control at all media queries with syntax - .c-d-{value}, .c{breakpoint}-d-{value}
+ Updated existing c-hidden classes to become inclusive rather than exclusive
+ Added more comprehensive display props that are not yet being compiled. 

The additional compiled classes creates quite a bit of overhead and filesize - so we are going to learn a bit more about the demand rather than releasing/supporting tons of classes. 

If your team is missing some responsive helpers please let us know!

## Up Next

All of the changes above will be hitting the docs soon. 

We are working with multiple teams helping them onboard cupcake or plan for onboarding. If your team is looking at scope or have any questions - please reach out - we are happy to help!

The UX team is continuing work on a number of larger components, layouts, etc. using Cupcake elements. Many of those will be available in future releases.

We also have alot more documentation to work through. There are tons of variations and ways to compose a UI with Cupcake, as well as useage rules from UX - we will continue to plow through adding as often as possible.
