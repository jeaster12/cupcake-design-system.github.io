### Distribution Graph Types
 Distribution analaysis visualizes data to see what data deviates from the norm and can also be used geographically to demonstrate data over a map. Charts used in this category include histograms, line and area charts, scatter plots, data tables, and map charts.
 Distribution graphs can answer:
 - What correlation between a cause and effect of a variable?
 - Does my user need to spot bugs or constraints in their system?
 - Does my consumer need a visual for a variable such as profits over different categories such as clients?
